\section{Dataset}

The Dataset is a combination of both red and white wine data to asses the quality of wines given specific data.
Namely:

\begin{itemize}
\item fixed acidity
\item volatile acidity
\item citric acid
\item residual sugar
\item chlorides
\item free sulfur dioxide
\item total sulfur dioxide
\item density
\item pH
\item sulphates
\item alcohol
\item quality (score between 0 and 10)
\end{itemize}

Number of Instances: red wine - 1599; white wine - 4898.
Number of Attributes: eleven + output attribute

We are using the eleven attributes to predict the quality of the wine
We initially had it as the quality between 0 and 10,but this posed a classification problem as there where too many possible outcomes and data for the outliers (0,1,2,8,9,10) thus we changed the
